## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome but we ask a few things:
* Do not make pulls requests to master use a feature branch that starts with `feature/` for features and `bug/` for bugs.
* Use eslint and the config included but the basics are;
    * Tabs not spaces.
    * Double quotes not singles.
* Leave the code in a better state than when you started.
* Dont update the version number in `package.json` but feel free to add yourself as a contributor.
* If you make changes requiring documentation please add it.
* If you wish to add a large change or feature make a issue first and check with us.
